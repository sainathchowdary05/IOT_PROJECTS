# 🌐 IOT_PROJECTS

A collection of **IoT (Internet of Things) projects** built using platforms like **Arduino**, **ESP32**, **ESP8266**, **Raspberry Pi**, and various sensors and modules. These projects are focused on **automation, safety, smart systems, and embedded development**.

## 🔧 Projects Included

| Project Name                         | Description |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| 🔥 LPG Gas Detector                  | Detects gas leakage using MQ2 sensor and alerts via GSM and buzzer |
| 🌡️ Temperature-Controlled Fan        | Automatically controls fan speed using DHT11 sensor and PWM |
| 🏠 Smart Home System                 | Controls lights, fans, and appliances using Wi-Fi and sensors |
| Blind Stick                          | Detects obstacles (walls, humans, dogs) and steps using camera and ultrasonic sensors |
| 📍 GPS Location Tracker              | Tracks location and sends coordinates via GSM module |
| 💡 Light Automation                  | Controls lights based on motion (PIR sensor) or light level (LDR) |
